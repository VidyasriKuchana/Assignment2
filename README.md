This is a program to print the given String i.e., name inside a rectangular format.

For example, if the user gives abcd as the string, the output will be like :

            +-------------------------------------------+
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |                                     abcd  |
            |                                           |
            +-------------------------------------------+

We can make the number of rows and columns also dynamic by using scanner class and reading them from the console. But here in code, I gave the number of rows and columns manually.
